# Windows-Chromebook-Embedded-Controller

This application helps control EC Functions with an application. This project is intended for chromebooks, and only works with Coolstars crosec 2.0 Drivers. WIndows Defender will see this application as a trojan, that is becuase I have not yet signed the application since it is very early in the works. Exclude the file that is viewed as a trojan, and open the app. This is an open-source project, you can check if there is a trojan.
